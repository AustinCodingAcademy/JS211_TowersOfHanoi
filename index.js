// // * This js file is incomplete. It will log to the console the elements you click
//     // call another function and set stone. You will have to work through the logic
//     // of the game as you know it from building it in the terminal. Work through the
//     // puzzle slowly, stepping through the flow of logic, and making the game work.
//     // Have fun!!
// // * First run the program in your browser with live server and double-click on the row you'd like to select an element from.

// const stone = null

// // this function is called when a row is clicked. 
// // Open your inspector tool to see what is being captured and can be used.
// const selectRow = (row) => {
//   const currentRow = row.getAttribute("data-row")
  
//   console.log("Yay, we clicked an item", row)
//   console.log("Here is the stone's id: ", row.id)
//   console.log("Here is the stone's data-size: ", currentRow)

//   pickUpStone(row.id)
// } 

// // this function can be called to get the last stone in the stack
// // but there might be something wrong with it...
// const pickUpStone = (rowID) => {
//   const selectedRow = document.getElementById(rowID);
//   stone = selectedRow.removeChild(selectedRow.lastChild);
//   console.log(stone)
// }

// // You could use this function to drop the stone but you'll need to toggle between pickUpStone & dropStone
// // Once you figure that out you'll need to figure out if its a legal move...
// // Something like: if(!stone){pickupStone} else{dropStone}

// const dropStone = (rowID, stone) => {
//   document.getElementById(rowID).appendChild(stone)
//   stone = null
// }

// // * Remember you can use your logic from 'main.js' to maintain the rules of the game. But how? Follow the flow of data just like falling dominoes.
