// * This js file is incomplete. It will log to the console the elements you click

// but there might be something wrong with it...

// You could use this function to drop the stone but you'll need to toggle between pickUpStone & dropStone
// Once you figure that out you'll need to figure out if its a legal move...
// Something like: if(!stone){pickupStone} else{dropStone}

const dropStone = (rowID, stone) => {

}

// * Remember you can use your logic from 'main.js' to maintain the rules of the game. But how? Follow the flow of data just like falling dominoes.
