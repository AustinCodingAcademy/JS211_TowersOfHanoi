This is my code plan:
1. Copy all Code to another file, so I can work the logic out with the browser
and be able to easily transfer data that I want to the main file. This will help me avoid messing up functional code if I start experiemnting.
2. Start with the movement of peices. Once I get them moving, it will be easy to identify my bugs.
3. Will likely spend most of my time in isLegal.
4. Once legal moves have been worked out, start checking for win conditions.
5. Pass pre-written tests.
6. Write my own tests.
7. Turn in.
