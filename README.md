Towers of Hanoi

Code Plan:

  -- accept input from the user in the form of "fromStack" and "toStack" to represent the move the user wants to make

  -- validate the input for errors

  -- check to see if the proposed move is legal according to the rules:
        -- only one piece can be moved at a time
        -- a piece cannot be placed on top of a smaller piece

  -- if the move is legal, update the array, increment the move counter and check to see if the game is over

  -- if the game is over, alert the user that they have SUCCEEDED IN THEIR QUEST!
